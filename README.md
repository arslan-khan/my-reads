# My Reads - First project of Udacity's React nano degree

A simple yet fully interactive and scale-able single page app to virtually manage books. Built with ReactJS only.

## Getting Started

**Note: This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).**

1 - Before you start working, you first need to setup your environment. Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) (npm alternative but much better)

2 - Once your environment is prepared, open a command prompt (terminal) and type in the following:

- clone this repo
- cd into it
- yarn (to install all the dependencies)
- yarn start

3 - Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. "**Hallelujah**".

4 - For more productivity you can install Chrome's [React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en)
